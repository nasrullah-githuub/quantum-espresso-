# Quantum ESPRESSO Outputs and Python Post-Processing â€“ Cesium Halide Perovskites

This repository contains selected **output files** from my **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** calculations using **Quantum ESPRESSO (QE)**, along with **Python scripts** used for post-processing tasks such as analyzing band structures and density of states (DOS).

All calculations were performed in a **Linux environment** using **CSC Finlandâ€™s high-performance computing resources** (Puhti and Mahti).
